  # Bucket
  ## Extensible Storage/Transport Component(s)

  Bucket(s) read/write/store Data directly to the Cloud drive.
  Bucket(s) also mutate and forward data. For example the Mac
  client uses an Obj-C Class SparseBundleFreezer for it's
  storage needs so we need to have a server-side Bucket/map
  of that data store and the Unix and Windows versions
  will need a map too at some point.
