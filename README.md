# LovMx + ILvMx.
## Orbital Magic for Cloud Apps.
### LoveMx + Internet Love and #virtual Magic #exchange

LovMx + ILvMx are free and open source nonprofit projects 
to host a global namespace of code/data/blobs.

We are fun (silljays.com).
We develop a cloud app server (this project).
We develop a reference cloud app client (lolnub.app). 
We host a public data service (ilvmx.com).
We give away the best Web Theme Park on the net. (lolnub.com)

In a nutshell, we wanna build: 
 
*An Elixir-based Wolfram Language 
powered by a Twitter like network 
of Markdown-style documents 
for Clients connected to their own private VPN/VM
running an Orbital Magic framework written in the 
sexiest language/runtime in the world, oh my dear love Erlang/Elixir, 
for the purpose of creating a grassroots network
of Code + Data + Data storage aka Cake Apps 
written by commerce and community 
in a *meticulously* namespaced 
v2v storage-based network made 
completely open source and transparent.*

Yeah that sounds right.
